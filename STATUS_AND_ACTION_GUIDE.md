## ⚙️ How Optimization Settings Affect Actions

### **Intensity Setting** (5-30%)
- **Low Intensity (5-10%)**: Conservative - only recommends changes for big gaps
- **Medium Intensity (11-20%)**: Balanced - recommends changes for moderate gaps
- **High Intensity (21-30%)**: Aggressive - recommends changes for smaller gaps

### **Threshold Setting** (50-90%)
- **What it does**: Protects top X% of channels by reach
- **Example**: Threshold = 70% means top 70% of channels are "protected"
- **Protected channels**: Usually get MAINTAIN recommendation (unless critically underperforming)

## 📝 Quick Reference Table

| STATUS | Typical ACTION | Why? |
|--------|---------------|------|
| DOMINANT | MAINTAIN | Winning big - don't change |
| LEADING | MAINTAIN | Winning - keep strategy |
| CLOSE | MAINTAIN or INCREASE | Competitive - may need boost if not protected |
| BEHIND | INCREASE | Losing - invest more |
| CRITICAL | INCREASE | Urgent - invest significantly |
| OPPORTUNITY | ADD | Missing out - start here |
| MONOPOLY | MAINTAIN | Own it - maintain position |
| INACTIVE | (No action) | Not relevant |

## 💡 Key Takeaways

1. **STATUS = Current Situation** (where you are now)
2. **ACTION = Recommendation** (what to do about it)
3. **They can seem contradictory** (e.g., CLOSE + MAINTAIN) because:
   - STATUS looks at competitive position
   - ACTION considers protection, performance, and optimization settings
4. **PROTECTED channels** (top performers) usually get MAINTAIN even if STATUS is CLOSE/BEHIND
5. **The REASON column** explains why each ACTION was recommended

## 🎯 Example Interpretation

**Channel: "Star Plus"**
- **STATUS**: CLOSE
- **ACTION**: MAINTAIN
- **REASON**: "Top 70% - protected"

**What this means**:
- You're competitive with competitors (CLOSE status)
- But this channel is in your top 70% performers (protected)
- Recommendation: Keep current investment level
- **Business Decision**: "We're competitive here and it's a top performer - maintain investment"
